               The SICZ podcast creates circular playlists of vocal duets.
               Using individual artists as links we plot a course through the matrix taking as few steps as possible to create a loop. <br></br>
               We take subscribers song suggestions to start each episode, so explore the matrix, play with the builder and get in touch.
